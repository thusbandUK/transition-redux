      so the benefit of an array style for the different pages that go in each text box is that you can use array.length to
      tell the computer how many slides it should render before the right chevron disables

      buuuuut I'm not sure how that's going to work render wise because it has to render between different text boxes

      but of course you can always use an n + 1 approach to page forwarding, upto a maximum of array length

      now if you use separate object entries for each page, you can definitely write code, I mean it could be as simple as
      some kind of ternary operator, like, once the key with the n+1 number doesn't exist, it's time to disable the chevron...

      if you map the array, what are you saying? there's this many pages
